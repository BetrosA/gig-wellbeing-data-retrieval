0,magusat999,Angry funeral pax cancelled...,uberdrivers,12.0,1,"Im sorry. I just couldnt do it. I tried to be patient and compassionate, but after 4 calls, calling me all kinds of nasty names, referring to me in a racial slur, inciting an sngry mob that I could hear in the background - I had to cancel a woman at a funeral home. 

I understood she was sad, distraught, overcome with emotion. I would have sucked it up, but after the fourth call, cussing me out because she didnt get that I was u-turning to make pickup on the opposite side of the street where she was; accusing me of passing her by and continually asking me where I am... I couldnt let it slide anymore. I contemplated riding with this angry person and her mob, and I told her she needs to get another Uber - then cancelled. She was so busy cussing me, she probably didnt hear anything.

I dont think I ever want ti pick up or drop off funeral people. Its too much of an emotional burden.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/f4nifm/angry_funeral_pax_cancelled/

47,DruidTrixxx,Ubereats newest payout came to my city - 2 week results.ü§î,uberdrivers,12.0,1,"So a couple of weeks ago, ubereats latest(confusing) payout came to my city finally. I have read about it on threads. And everyone says they make less. Its been about 2 weeks now, &amp; I can see that they were all correct. Even though I still make way more than the average ubereater. I get really big tips regularly. I have had 100% rating with over 2000 deliveries. So I clearly am very good at delivering peoples food( not sure how people can mess that up). I deliver mainly graveyard hours. Sometimes ill start dinner. Mostly I start at 8 pm &amp; go till 4 am on weekends especially. Sometimes ill only do 2 or 3 hrs during the week. During the heart of the corona panic I have been pulling $40 - 50 per hr consistant. Before corona I was doing about 25-30$ . Now since the pay change im back down to $25 - 35 or 40 on good weekends. Its still corona time. And people are still tipping great. The pay per delivery lowered considerably. Like sometimes 2.0 boosts dont even add up to $1 a mile, which is sad. $1 a mile should be the minimum anyone should get paid to deliver. I dont know what no boost even comes out to? Maybe 50 cents a mile! My calculations are that about $25 per hr when its all said &amp; done is about minimum wage if you have a brand new vehicle. If you have an older vehicle you will spend more money on fixing it. Anything lower than $20 per hr &amp; you are making slave wages. Me personally, I will only do $25 at lowest. If I ever have long periods of $20 per hr ill stop. I dont see how they can lower the base pay anymore than it is already. I get $10, 20$ tips that make up for the base pay.

53,DruidTrixxx,,uberdrivers,,1,,Im lucky to be in a great spot. By my house people are ordering uber eats all night long. Jack in the box &amp; dennys 24 hrs. Midnight to 4 am is on fire by my house. No traffic. Drunk people tip me well. I used to do it in the day time when I first started. Before they showed the addresses. It sucked! Id get sent accross town. I only pulled $15 an hr usually. Once they began showing the addresses &amp; miles I cherry pick in my neighborhood. And I quit doing it in the day. Too much wait times &amp; traffic. Right now im only doing drive throughs because im not wearing a stupid mask. But its still nonstop with only drive throughs. People hate mcdonalds but I love them if its not packed. After 9 the mcdonalds arent bad. They close at 12 &amp; 1 on weekends. Its all in the tips. I can sometimes get 15$ for a little 1 mile mcdonalds run. I can get several of them in a row even at times. But I know that is not the norm. I dont want anyone ubering in my neighborhood. I want it all. I even kind of like it when they dont do high boosts because nobody will uber. I get double orders all night nonstop. No wait time. Im not even done delivering one when they are sending me another. I love it when its like that. When they do really high boosts thats when people want to do it.

54,passingby2018,,uberdrivers,,1,,"Maybe it's my market, but I've noticed that in my market UE is cheap as fuck, usually $5 and it is difficult to do 3 delivery per hour in general.

I just can't imagine how you can pull in $30 or $40 regularly with UE, they are cheap as fuck, even with DoorDash I am doing $25 usually.

91,APettyJ,,uberdrivers,,2,,"The federal component of the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance that provides a $600 weekly supplement in addition to whatever state unemployment a person is collecting, is set to stop after the week of July 18th. Right now many drivers are collecting more via unemployment assistance than they would earn risking it by driving during the pandemic. If that weekly $600 payment is not extended in one form or another, many drivers will be forced to return to work, although some may just ride it out with the state unemployment alone, which could last until December.

Once a large amount of drivers who are collecting return to the workforce, it will drive down the surge as well as the frequency of trips offered; much less ping stacking, especially considering that rider demand is still pretty significantly down, although it is rising from its nadir of the pandemic. This is coupled with the fact that Summer tends to be dead in many markets, anyway.

Here's hoping the government gives most of those drivers a reason to stay home by extending the Fed component, if not at $600 then at something not far off, like $400.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/hpxzdc/is_everyone_having_good_promos_in_the_their_market/fxv5rbn/

235,Diganleqmemori,What has been the best conversation you‚Äôve had with a passenger?,uberdrivers,4.0,1,"Assuming you‚Äôre the talking type, of course.  I very, very rarely speak unless a rider prompts it.  Most of the time, after initial pleasantries, I just about ignore them until we arrive wherever they are going.  Not that I‚Äôm anti social, I just know what it‚Äôs like being a passenger in with a overly chatty driver.  

I‚Äôd say deep conversations happen maybe 1 out of 20 rides, or so.  By ‚Äúdeep‚Äù I mean conversations that go beyond casual, for example, I had a 40 minute conversation with a guy about space travel, something I‚Äôm extremely interested in.  So was he, and it was a good one.  I was kind of sad to see him go.  

There was also a couple who told me a fascinating story about how they got rich (and lucky) in the stock market.  They were in their mid 30s, and were pretty much set for life.  Can‚Äôt say for sure if they were being truthful, but I did pick them up from one of the most expensive hotels in my city, and got a $25 cash tip on a $10 ride, so...maybe?  

Number 1 would have to be a fellow vet.  Turned out me and this guy were the same age, and were at the same duty station at the same time, only in different units.  That was way back in the 00s.  Back in ‚Äò01, before 9/11, there was a brawl at the bowling alley on post.  Basically, on the weekends, scores of young soldiers would hit the bowling alley near the barracks.  There was a mixture of guys from different units, eg, infantry, artillery, cav, etc.  Long story short, we both were there, but didn‚Äôt know each other, although there‚Äôs a good chance we saw other.

Online classes and social distancing really ruined the college experience for a lot of kids. She starts telling me about how her son had little to no guidance from his academic advisor, was already struggling in classes, hated the food, didnt feel comfortable wandering the local town, etc. When I told her I went to the same school she starts asking me what parts of her sons stories seemed like scared freshman problems and what were actual issues about the school/area.

I slowed down my driving so we could have a long-ish chat about the college, gave her advice to tell her son. All I knew about local areas he should visit or should stay away from, how to do well without relying on the schools crappy advisors/tutors, what food spots are guaranteed to give you food poison. Even gave her some social media accounts the student use to vent about campus issues, stuff the school tries to keep quiet.

She thanked me a dozen times, said she learned more about the college in our 20min drive than weeks of phone calls, websites, and tours.

240,Sallyman40,I really think we should be allowed to go back and change the original rating we gave a pax (RANT),uberdrivers,48.0,1,"Backstory:

Last night was the night before Halloween, in my town everyone still dresses up and what not. I had a dope costume and was receiving a ton of compliments.
Unfortunately I was driving in a student area, and most students don‚Äôt tip and I‚Äôm ok with that.

Fast forward and I pick up this older couple (40s) from downtown and drop them off at their luxurious home.

While driving them, they asked if I‚Äôve been receiving a lot of tips because of my costume. I explain to them that I‚Äôve been mostly driving students, so no.

Women: Wow students are just shitty people, that‚Äôs just sad. Babe make sure you tip our driver nicely.

Man: I‚Äôm doing that right now.

Me: thanks that really helps a lot.

Drop them off. No tip 16h later.

I know I know, how many people have come on here and ranted about an empty promised tip. But damn that couple was worse than the ‚Äòstudents‚Äô she said were shitty, at least they don‚Äôt promise empty tips.

I firmly believe we should be able to go back and change the ratings we originally gave them because no way in hell I would give them 5 stars based off that bs. If passengers can change our rating, why can‚Äôt we change theres?

I usually give a low rating to anyone who promises a tip during the ride, but the fact that the man said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing it right now‚Äù led me to believe he was actually tipping in the moment since his face was locked onto his smartphone.

I can only assume the 30k you mentioned is the same stupid spin conspiracy nuts put on CDC data about comorbidities that never said COVID only caused 7% or whatever of counted deaths, but that the other 93% of deaths had associated complications like *lung failure* or *heart failure *. In fact the CDC even went out of its way to count people that literally didn't die of COVID and its a tiny fraction of people out of the hundreds of thousands dead and perhaps millions more with lasting impacts on their health 

The only way the numbers would be 30k above an average year is if somehow those 300k people would have died at some point this very year, something other papers have demonstrated to be patently false as far back as May.

I have driven, or shopped for: Uber, UberEats, Lyft, DoorDash, Postmates, Roadie, Instacart, Shipt, Burpy, Amazon Flex and just registered with CornerShop.

What is sad is these companies like to deactivate professional drivers because we pick, and choose what work we will do.

These companies will lie, tell you they cannot give information on your deactivation for ‚Äúprivacy reasons‚Äù.

If you are activated again, you are ‚Äúred flagged‚Äù for immediate deactivation without any warning.

I write this for the professional because we normally 40 hours plus per week.

I have been deactivated by Instacart for delivering to a house, and then the next door neighbor got the groceries and put them inside her house.

All went well, and I was reactivated. That was it for me after 3500 plus shops. I never did another shop. 

I do this work not only to make a living, I do it to learn, to inform and to help my fellow drivers, and shoppers.

My information is always free.
