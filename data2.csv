0,squigglyted,I've had a few last straw moments,uberdrivers,2.0,1,"First one, picked up two young women who were apparently best friends, get into a fist fight in the back seat and pulling hair. I pull the angry dad and yell, ""I'm stopping this car! I can't have fighting in  here!"" I kick them out and report. 

Second one takes the cake, and makes me sad. I picked up what I assumed was a couple at a dodgy motel in Media, PA. It's a 2 destination drop off. Dropped off the guy first, woman second, who seemed fine until she passed out. Long story short, we got to her place, she tried to get out, fell backwards when she left my car, I offer assistance and she accepted. Keep in mind it's 1:30am, and as I walk towards her, she says, ""I'm a hot mess."" She then throws up like crazy, and I ask her if she wanted me to knock on her door, she said no. I look at her house, and there are two small children looking out the window. At that time, I was speculating like crazy. She told me to drive away, which I did. After about a block, I did make sure she got back in which she did. 

Currently, I'm in the process of re-onboarding with a firm that had made an offer for me to return. I'm still doing Uber part time, so it's going to be a road ahead. But other than the things I complain about Uber, I've met some pretty cool people, made some new friends, and I have really messed up stories that I tell at parties.

This is why so many drivers quit after awhile.. other than the pay being low, some passengers just permanently ruin it for you.  Uber still has that 'neat, new, cool' buzz to it for many, but I think in a couple more years once the newness wears off, and if the pay is still crappy, it might not be as popular as it is now.  The quality of the drivers (and passengers) has also noticebly declined over the past 1-2 years, because literally almost anyone can drive for Uber, and it's so cheap that anyone can pay for it.

3,niceloner10463484,Had my first real bad Pax since starting in October of last year.,uberdrivers,34.0,1,"This dude seemed nice at first, texted his where I was cuz the pin on my app is not his location. Even responded politely when I asked for seat belt. A minute after  I gently gave him advise I‚Äôve given to Countless others: make sure the pin is at where you are located. That‚Äôs when he blew the fuck up. ‚ÄúRespectfully, I HAD THE PIN EXACTLY WHERE I WAS DUMBFUCK!‚Äô And when we got done with his short trip (there was another pool pax next to him) he slammed my door after giving me a loud, brief lecture about ‚Äòrespecting your elders. I‚Äôm 24, he looked late 30s to 40s. How sad. He then knocked hard on my right passenger window/upper hood area, flipped me off, and said something like ‚ÄòYOU REMEMBER THAT DIPSHIT!‚Äô 

I asked the other pax, who was super chill guy just going to a mall, if he witnessed that. He told me he smelled alcohol in the guy‚Äôs breath. I told him if could call Uber Support on speaker to report that man child, he said yes, ‚ÄòI‚Äôll be your guide as I know exactly where I‚Äôm going‚Äô. I called Support, told them I wanted to report the guy. Support is crap as usually, said they‚Äôll be back after 1-2 mins, came back after 15 minute hold. Said they‚Äôll ‚Äòsend me email about this issue in 24-48 hrs.‚Äô Sigh, at least I managed to tell the jackass‚Äôs name to support. I am good now though, after dropped other pax off, picked up 2 really nice college kids in a row, and a guy on a business trip from another city. Those trips lifted my spirits immediately

I‚Äôm glad people/PAX are generally cool. I‚Äôve picked up PAX of all ages, ethnicities, socioeconomic backgrounds (I do not drive in the ghetto areas cuz fuck that shit, and no bar crowd/bar times either), and pretty much everyone I remembered has been super chill, even the weird ones. I‚Äôm also talkative and have had some very memorable conversations. This guy is a YUUUGGEE anomaly. I‚Äôll just let him stew in his rude misery. At least he didn‚Äôt drive and kill someone.

38,lukewind,Beware the Powapod - Consumer Warning,uberdrivers,4.0,1,"So I recently bought a Powapod, if you are not familiar just google it.  Its a cool looking backseat phone charger.   So I got mine ($50), because I hate threading a bunch of cables and it seemed to work good.

After 1 month it stopped charging anything and the mechanism that retracts the cords broke.  Obviously I could have had a dud but this seems to be a real problem with a lot of people who have one.  I email the company and they want me to send it to China to be repaired on my dime.

I am sad because PAX really liked this thing but paying the price of the device to get it fixed is not worth it.  The build quality of the cords are really poor and it wont mount in your car if your headseat post are not straight.   

So buy with a warning that the device does not hold up that well.

So we were leaving and I gave valet my ticket and forgot to get the stub from him I go to the door to wait and get a 10 spot ready, it really was one of the high points of my night(sad I know) to give this guy some joy of the 10$ I know the feeling of it,and it feels good. So 20min go by and I am kinda worried because my kids need to be picked up before a certain time. Some how they lost my ticket. Maybe fell on the floor and he forgot about it. It took 45min to get my car at this point and I was late to get my kids and I kinda freaked out and got all entitled on their ass's I was swearing in Spanish and English(not like my quiet self) my wife was kinda feeding me a little so I went all crazy because my kids were stranded at a child care facility. 
I ended up not tipping the valet, I know it's not his fault it was the guy getting the ticket I'm guessing. So its kind of like Uber rider pissed at an Uber issue and taking it out on the driver. I guess I am just another entitled prick. When it comes to my kids fuck all ya all. Lol

80,desertgoldfeesh,Support put in wrong debit card # - cash out went to random person. Uber support won't help.,uberdrivers,11.0,1,"Unbelievably frustrating 24 hours dealing with Uber Driver Support.

Roughly $250 worth of driving was deposited into some random &lt;very well known bank I use&gt; customer who has a debit card number almost identical to mine except the last 4 end in 1234 instead of 2134 (not the real numbers but you get it).

Support actually put the debit card number in for me because it wouldn't stick for me.  

The first ticket on the issue had Support completely misunderstanding what I was saying thanks to a pretty severe language barrier, but she was kind.  The second was escalated to security who basically gave me the ""too bad so sad"" treatment.  

Not trying to score sympathy points, but I am a father of three and the sole income earner and badly, badly need the additional income.  Obviously, everyone needs the cash but hooooly %@$# this is bad.  

This is ultimately my fault for not double checking, but has anyone had a scenario like this or had any luck with a similar situation?

103,XJadynX,I feel like at this point my Money is being held Hostage with ZERO transparency from uber.,uberdrivers,79.0,22,"Honestly Uber has had issues but not like this. Honestly Trips not going through for people for hours to days and more. People ( like myself ) not able to cash out who rely on being able to cash out to help pay for bills, or get gas or even something as basic as food. All we get told is either It'll be solved in 24 hours or It'll be fixed in a few hours just keep checking back. More then 24 hours later and then some the issue is still going on with little more then "" We're looking into it, it's a known issue "" from uber. No ETA, no nothing, just 1 statement and silence. 

&amp;#x200B;

10s if not 100s of thousands of workers going without what they are promised by a company already not known for a good reputation or that can be trusted. Is it any wonder uber finds itself on the short end of the stick so often? In a time like this someone needs to be out there out front talking to the people, trying to help at the VERY least keep us in even some kind of soft loop. Not this pre-recorded bullshit when you call. Not understaffed, unskilled Help services that can't give us more then canned answers after putting you on hold for 2 minutes. If this was ANY normal major company with this many unpaid workers there would be a fucking Riot and the Local if not Federal Government would be breathing down their neck. 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly at this point I'm feeling like everyone else. I feel like my money is being held Hostage and I don't trust Uber is telling me the truth. I'm feeling like something more is going on.. Yea it's a conspiracy theory, but with ubers rep and they things they have been caught doing in the past, I don't. We want our money, and uber isn't talking, and we are helpless and powerless to do anything, because the sad part is, Despite not being able to get paid, trips processing properly and uber not saying a damned thing.. people will still go out and drive for them. People will continue to work despite the fact they are not going to get to cash out, or even be sure they are going to get the right amount of money. There is also ZERO promise direct Deposits will go through this coming week. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I don't know what to do, any other company there would be a place I could go ( other then Green light which can do nothing as well ) Like HR or something and talk to people in person and get this resolved even if it meant getting a check cut for me.

Unfortunately, if Uber DID assess a cancel fee for any of the other reasons, riders would be crying foul left and right, regardless of whether we're being honest or not, because how can we prove that they didn't have car seats, or had too many passengers? The ONE thing that they CAN'T dispute is that we arrived at the pin, and waited for 5 minutes.

Next time, if it's feasible, start within range of the pin, go around the block or to the other end of the parking lot, and either ride the timer out or wait for them to cancel, and collect your fee.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/9k0a3v/apparently_not_all_cancelations_are_recording/e6vfaru/

205,aquagardenia,This pax and his daughter literally made me cry,uberdrivers,66.0,1,"So this happened a couple of months ago now, but I thought I would still share because it's not everyday I get a pax like this:

I picked up a father and adult daughter from a hotel for a trip across town. It seemed like the daughter lived in the area but it was the dad's first time in the city. He said he wanted me to take them to Walgreens. The Walgreen's was on the other side of town, but I was like ok whatever. On the way, he started talking about homeless people and how he wanted to help them. 

For background, my city has a really big homeless population and the mayor/council have had a really difficult time getting a handle on it so it's sort of rampant and no one seems to know what to do about it. I told them a few stories about things I'd witnessed like two little girls brushing their teeth in a park bathroom and then going back to sleep in their family's minivan. He said that made him really sad.

When we got to the drug store, he asked me to wait and said he'd tip, so I did. But they didn't go into the drug store.

These people had me take them across town to a specific area they had researched so he and his daughter could go around handing out $20 bills to homeless people. I cried when I saw them talking to this one old man laying on the sidewalk and he looked genuinely so touched and shocked.

I waited for 5-10 minutes while they talked to people and gave them money and when they were done I took them back to their hotel and they tipped me $20.

It's really common here to be cynical about giving to the homeless and I understand why. But that didn't stop me from being extremely touched by what these people did.

If that guy handed out $1000, I bet $800+ of it went to buy these types of things.  

Also interestingly enough, there are plenty of ‚Äúhomeless‚Äù people that are in fact not homeless. People fake it all the time to pull at the heart strings of suckers.   Some are very good at it too.  

There‚Äôs a guy that hangs out downtown in the raggiest clothes you‚Äôve ever seen playing his ukelele and singing songs.

I needed up giving him $10 because I didn‚Äôt have $8 exactly and he went straight across the block to the liquor store after I left.  

Turns out the ‚Äúbus ride‚Äù thing is very popular.  I hear it all the time.  I suspect they ask for less than $10 because it sounds better and if you don‚Äôt have enough singles you‚Äôre likely to round up to $10.

A buddy of mine just recently wrapped up this program called Praxis. Its kinda like a trade school for entrepreneurs. 1 year program 6 month online study second half is an intensive internship. The whole course isfocused on relevant stuff you actually need to know so no leisure studies, no womens studies, no social justice all practical stuff. The program costs 11k and when you come out you'll have made min 13k because your working a paid internship the second half. upon completion your gurnateed a job making 45k or 50k. sounds to good to be true right, the only catch is they are very selective and only take about 11% of applicants. I wish they had something like this when I was in school. I hope to see more programs like this pop up as college is overpriced and kind of antiquated in terms of making you waste 4 years and tens of thousands of dollars taking nonsesnse courses that have nothing to do with your degree area. best of all when you come out of college your not really ready for a job, your not trained at anything, employers just know this guy was able to jump through these hoops to get this piece of paper so he's trainable andnot a complete idiot",https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/a2maxa/this_sucks_what_new_rates_have_done_to_a_full/eb0xhi4/

Unfortunately I think the only way to really get ahead in this world we live in is to have a very unique skill, to start your own business which is reliant on as afew other parties as possible, or do sales where your income isn't really capped its all about what you produce. outside of that were all just cogs in the wheel and I dont see that changing. 

I think the key is to spot opportunities ahead of others and get in early. If Uber really was as good as people say it was 3-5 years ago the smart people got in early made their money and are moving on to other things now.

319,MikePyp,It's sad that I care more about your child's safety then you do.,uberdrivers,29.0,1,"Had a pick up at a hospital tonight. I pull up and there is a man with a small child. He had a rear facing bassinet style car seat but I didn't see the base. I asked where it was and he said it was upstairs in the hospital. I told him I wouldn't take him without the appropriate equipment. He tries making some bullshit excuses but I hold strong and he goes back inside to get it. I should have canceled right then and there but it's Christmas time and I don't know what situation brought him to the hospital so I decide to be a decent human being and wait for him to return. He comes back with all the right things and then I watch him tuck the straps that are supposed to anchor the seat to the car into the base and put the bassinet on top of them. He then proceeded to try to put the child in it. I told him that I need him to install the seat correctly. Again he tries arguing with me. In the process of arguing with me he actually turns this thing completely around and proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is not at all anchored to the car. Now I'm done with this guy, I'm not taking this liability. And as a father of two who removes and installs car seats all the time I know exactly how easy it is to do in my car and I'm really pissed off about this extreme laziness and lack of concern for him child's wellbeing. I cancel the ride and tell him he needs a different driver. He continues trying to argue as I remove the key from my car and go open the hatch to remove his belongings in the back. As he's arguing he starts threatening me physically. In my head during this time all I could think was ""please try it so I can kick your ass and get the police over here to take your kid away from you"".

So I picked up a girl in the a.m.  She was in an apartment complex, so I call for some guidance.  This was ACTUALLY on lyft, so she had a profile pic that looked pretty good. She assured me that she was coming down, and said ""Please, please, dont leave me.""  Usually I leave, but she looked pretty good and she begging me not to leave, so fuck it. It was also 6:40 a.m and she wouldve been my first ride of the day.

She came down like 4 minutes after the wait time.  In the ride she is pretty social, we are having a great conversation. Half way to her job, she starts complimenting my car smell, as well as my beard, and saying I look very young, and she always gets old guys.

At the end of the ride she tells me she's been here from Chicago for 6 months, and doesn't have many friends here.  Said sorry if she seems like a creep, but she wanted to exchange numbers. She wasnt as hot as her picture, but she was still cute. We exchange numbers, I send a simple text saying it was nice to meet you.

She responded back immediately saying the same, and also called me boo, and that she can't use her phone at work but she will hit me up on lunch or when she gets off.  

Anyways, we end up hanging out the very next day. On this very next day, we make out, I get oral, and a handjob.

Then we hang out again the next day and I smashed reeeeaaaal good. This was 2 weeks ago, and I smashed 2x a day, 4 different days already, plus the day i got oral.     Now the days I dont smash, she gets all sensitive and sad, so I put my foot down and told her to calm that shit. She basically bowed down to me and I got this chick at the tip of my fingertips...

Or the tip of my d*ck tip.  Lol.

She starts talking to me about how great/friendly the people are in the area. Travels a lot and has never been in the area. As she is about to exit my car, she says she's gonna try to find a guy to, ""have someone eat out my pussy. Something, something..practice safe sex (paraphrasing) cause all I heard was the first sentence  : )  ""Shit, I'm good at that. I'd be down to eat some pussy.""  Says she'd leave all her options open. Gives me her card with number. I tell her I'll be out for a few more hours and we part ways. 3 hours go by. I text her and play it cool and ask her if she will need a ride or anything else. I get nothing back for 15 minutes.  Text her again telling her I'm going to take a break and grab some food. Text me if you need anything. Immediately texts back saying she could eat as well. Pick her up after 5 minutes of texting and waiting for her ass to leave the bar.
Begins talking about how GREAT everyone here is, again. And just requests to go back to her hotel and we can order a pizza. I comply. I spend about and hour and half at her hotel eating pizza and pussy. It's almost 1AM, thus, I'm tired. Still have to drive a decent amount to get home.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/akcuon/had_sex_with_a_pax/ef40w4w/

First time her boyfriend skipped out of town and only told her he was leaving a few hours before he departed. She wasn't happy with him,  at all. After a minute or so of flirting with me, she said, "" What he doesn't know won't hurt him, right?"" I drop her off at a Marina restaurant. We eat and leave. She's watching her mom and stepdads condo. We bang there. 2nd girl was still my longest ride. 40 minutes to a small town and back. Had a lot in common. Went out for the night. Met some new people at the bar. Head to there place. Outside the apartment, we do the dirty in the very back with the seats down. I have a feeling there will be more.
